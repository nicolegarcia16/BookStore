# BookStore
A basic MVC web application designed for a class. 
Some abilities have been left out, but would be good to add in at a later date.
These abilities include:
 1. Remembering a user after they sign in.
 2. Allowing for actual card information to be input and verified.
 3. Maintaining a database connection for storing book inventories, encrypted login information, and purchase history.
Also, the isbn numbers for the books are not the actual isbn numbers for those books. This was a class project,
and I do not have an actual bookstore, so it was unimportant to have the correct information. In the case that this project were turned
into an actual online bookstore, the correct information would, of course, be provided.
